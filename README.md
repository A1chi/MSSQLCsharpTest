# MSSQLCsharpTest
/*This is a test version of the program for working with the MYSQL database, implemented using WF.

If you want to use some parts of the program or check the entire program, do not forget to change the connection string in the CONFIGS.
Also, do not forget to change the name of the tables and columns in them.
I used an open Microsoft database. And the program is configured for it.























I'm just learning, don't judge strictly. */
